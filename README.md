# Multivariate_Multiomics
Sanjeevani & Amon :)

Compaere the methods used to anlayze multiomics 
* metagenomics: composition of community
* metabolomics: quantification of small molecules in a sample

Experiment: bisphenol-S (plastic precursor) -> bps
* lingers in mammalian bodies for 24-48 hours
* after ingestion, BPS is abosrbed, conjugated in the liver (glucuronidation), returned to the gut ...
* ... deconjugated by the microbiota, and the parent BPS is liberated --> exposed to the gut
* effect of bps on mammilian gut microbiome

1. Can cause dybiois (community structure)
2. Bacterial ability to change bps
3. changing metabolic output (metabolomic profile)

Process: fecal matter -> spiked w/ bps medium (PBS)
* no growth medium becasue bacterial structure change limited by time (0d ,1d, 2d)
  -> untargeted metabolomics analyses [metabolic dataset]
  -> shogun metagenomics (read + assembly, realtive abundance)

PCA to metagenomics (realtive abundance)-> beta diversity
* between community varaiance


GOAL: 
* Some sort of Descision Tree
  * Pre-processing -> Method -> Processing
* Increasing Utility and Accessibility, based on research question
* ICA is new. whereas PCA and (s)PLS-DA is used a lot -> maybe some recommendation

Assessing : Clustering, Feature Selection, INterpretation/visualization
* Kmeans, Hclust, ANOVA
